    "synopsis": "The breeze is blowing, the night is thick, outside the lonely city. A group of women lit lights and stood quietly under the city gate wearing red robes. Their eyes were all set in the distance, in a fog, they were waiting, waiting for the return of their beloved who went out to fight. Once upon a time, the men in the entire city came out to defend their families and the country, and today is the day they agreed to return. At dawn, the sound of horses' hooves suddenly broke the long silence outside the city...\n\n(Source: Movie Douban, translated)",
