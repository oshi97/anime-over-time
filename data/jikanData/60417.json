    "synopsis": "Deep in the white mist, there was a table where the dishes floated. Three little girls lived there, playing together happily, but they all seemed a little bored. One day, a peacock appeared, and the girls were deeply shocked by their encounter.\n\nWhat you have seen is only a small part of the world. The \"curiosity,\" \"anxiety,\" and \"emotion\" that are born from encountering something new are depicted in vivid colors. Imagine yourself reading a picture book and try to get a little taste of this relaxing world.\n\n(Source: JDN, translated)",
