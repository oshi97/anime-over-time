    "synopsis": "Kawamo wo Suberu Kaze\nReturning to Japan to visit her parents after five years abroad, Noriko does not know what to expect. While some things in Kanazawa have changed and some things have stayed the same, Noriko cannot help but dredge up memories of her youth and secrets she thought she had left behind.\n\nYuuge\nTrapped in a loveless marriage, Mimi has little excitement in her life until a rendezvous with the local garbage man, Kou, turns into something more. Now living with Kou—but still married to someone else—Mimi reflects on the decisions that brought her to this point and whether she should prioritize appearances or her happiness.\n\nJinsei Best Ten\nHatoko Nikawa has a habit of reflecting on her \"best ten,\" the most memorable moments of her life, but is somewhat dismayed that, despite her 39 years on Earth, her best ten moments all occurred before her 18th birthday. Hearing that her middle school reunion is coming up, Hatoko hopes to reunite with her first love without knowing how much he has changed or whether he can live up to her expectations.\n\nDokoka Dewanai Koko\nWith an adult son who sleeps all day, a daughter who barely returns home, and a husband who lost his job, Maho Katou bears a lot of stress. Working nights at a local store to support her family, she has little time for sleep or pleasure. With Maho constantly overexerting herself, it may only be a matter of time until she collapses under pressure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
