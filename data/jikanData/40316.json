One day, they meet Kumachi, a talking teddy bear fairy sent by her master Phandy to search for the wish-granting artifacts, the \"Reverse Jewels\" that can corrupt a human's heart. Kumachi later chooses them to become Phantomirage, a Robin Hood-styled phantom thieves of justice to acquire the Reverse Jewels with the promise of granting their own wishes. The Phantomirage proceed in this by purifying people who are corrupted by the Gyakugyaku-Police, a group of bad cops who use the Reverse Jewels to turn those they arrest into \"Ikenaiers\", an evil polarized versions of themselves. Becoming mass media sensations while attracting the attention of the actual police who are investigating them and the Gyakugyaku-Police, the Phantomirage members are warned to conceal their identities from the public. \n\n(Source: Wiki)",
