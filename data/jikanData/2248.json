    "synopsis": "The Konohagakure Grand Sports Festival has begun with all ninja squads vying for the ultimate prize—a whole week of paid leave! Despite his enthusiasm to achieve victory alongside Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, Naruto Uzumaki finds himself in a pinch due to unexpected digestion problems. Caught between the competition and his personal emergency, he faces never-ending obstacles in his frantic search for a way out of the troublesome situation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Although Naruto: Dai Katsugeki!! Yuki Hime Shinobu Houjou Dattebayo! - Konoha no Sato no Dai Undoukai was screened together with Naruto Movie 1: Dai Katsugeki!! Yuki Hime Shinobu Houjou Dattebayo! during the latter's premiere in Japan, the short animated feature was not shown at the movie's release in North America as well. Instead, it was included on the DVD version made available on September 4, 2007 as well as in the Naruto Triple Feature DVD collection, released on October 14, 2014. Falling somewhere before the first series' \"Sasuke Recovery Mission\" arc or prior to episode 107, the OVA is notable for showing every character—living or dead—from the Naruto franchise.",
