    "synopsis": "Hao Ren was originally a young man who lived in a fourth-tier city and lived on the meager rent of an old house. When he went out to work, he accidentally became a \"universe police officer\". While he was still struggling to accommodate a group of abnormal creature tenants arranged by his superiors, his jurisdiction, the Dream Plane Universe, had already brewed a cosmic crisis. The mystery of the origin of abnormal creatures on Earth and the ruins of civilization in the Dream Plane Universe seem to be connected in some way. As Hao Ren's investigation deepened, the eldest son's world-destroying natural disaster, the goddess of creation fell, and one after another of the dusty and terrifying cases that had been buried for thousands of years bombarded his already useless brain circuit. Hao Ren gradually realized that he might not be able to slack off...\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
