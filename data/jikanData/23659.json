    "synopsis": "Abandoned as a child, Zuku has become a brigand to survive. One night after committing a robbery, he is approached by a strange little girl who prompts him to visit the pine grove beach nearby. Upon arriving there, Zuku is surprised to discover an unconscious young woman covered in a sparkling veil. Enticed by its splendid material, he snatches the fabric and attempts to flee. But its owner unexpectedly awakens, begging him to return the precious accessory.\n\nWith no other memory save for the veil's importance, the woman refuses to let Zuku leave without recovering it. Showing no remorse, the bandit violently renounces her plea—but little does he know, this unusual encounter will change his life forever. \n\nInspired by a renowned Japanese legend, Hi no Tori: Hagoromo-hen follows the intertwined fates of two individuals who learn to comfort one another amongst their troubles, illustrating the power of compassion and its ability to transform even the most bitter of hearts. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Hi no Tori: Hagoromo Hen is a short anime adaptation of the \"Hagoromo-hen\" chapter from Osamu Tezuka's Hi no Tori manga. Translated in English by Viz under the title \"Robe of Feathers,\" this chapter is mostly inspired by Japan's famous eighth century Hagoromo legend. However, the adaptation's plot is slightly different from the manga's, especially with respect to the character Zuku. The movie was shown at the Tezuka Osamu World Cinema in Kyoto from July 17, 2004 until the theater was closed on January 16, 2011. The production team was almost identical to the Hi no Tori TV anime series' production team, but the voice actress of the Phoenix was changed.",
