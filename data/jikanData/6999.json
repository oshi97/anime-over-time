He sets out to rectify this by getting himself into an idiotic situation, but his tennis club teammates do not seem to understand what he is doing.\n\nAru Hi no Oshitari 2\nEven though he is supposed to be the humorous one, Kenya Oshitari is concerned that his recent \"manzai\" jokes have not been landing. Luckily for him, his teammate from the Shitenhouji Middle School tennis team, Hikaru Zaizen, has come to save the day by replacing him as the laughing stock in the jokes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
