    "synopsis": "The PANDORA VOXX Project is a Vocaloid song series created by Kemu Voxx primarily using the Vocaloids IA and Megpoid that follows the effects of a device capable of granting wishes.\n\nDue to his former best friend, Hijiri, taking advantage of some trouble from middle school, Souhei, a second year in high school, was isolated in his class. He does not get along with one family member, his aunt, and even the one person who understands and who he has secretly fallen in love with, his childhood friend Haruka, has become someone Souhei's hand cannot reach. Furthermore, ever since he met a mysterious girl called Maki, his isolation in class had sped up. Souhei, who lost his place to belong, realizes that his own body is not reflected in others' eyes, and his voice does not reach others. He has become an invisible person...\n\n(Source: Pandora-voxx Wikia)\n\nThis entry encompasses the official kinetic typography music videos published on the PANDORA VOXX complete DVD/BD release with minimalism animation by ke-sanβ and illustrations by Hatsuko.
