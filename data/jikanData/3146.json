And their next target is Japan! The hero of this animation Daisaku Kusama, who works in a diving shop, encounters a mysterious girl, simply called V who leads him to make a contract with an enormous robot \"Giant Robo 1 (GR1)\" at the ancient ruins (Minami Yonaguni Island) in Okinawa. \n\nHe made a contract with UNISOM (good guys) and was approved to be a commander of GR1. Thus his battle has begun against GRO (bad guys) and creates a lot of dramas. Before long, Giant Robo of the 21st century will ask the world the true meaning of its power. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
