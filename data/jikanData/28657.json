    "synopsis": "Some say that Japanese drum bridges serve as a channel between two worlds—the living realm and the afterlife. To answer the ancient question of what exactly transpires at the eternal crossing point, psychedelic twists and abstract visuals explore the legendary chaos that ensues at the enigmatic border between the mundane and the divine. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Red Colored Bridge is among the final animated works of Keiichi Tanaami, one of the leading pop artists of postwar Japan, that he created at the age of 76. The animation, along with a large drawing collection, premiered during Tanaami's solo exhibition in the Nanzuka Underground contemporary art gallery in Tokyo from July 7, 2012 to August 5, 2012. It was screened at various festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, including the Image Forum Festival in Japan, the Vancouver International Film Festival in Canada, and the Fantoche International Animation Film Festival in Switzerland. The video streaming platform Music Art Fashion Forward now hosts the animation for free public viewing.",
