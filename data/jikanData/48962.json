    "synopsis": "Su Luo was kidnapped by her love rival Li Yaoyao and her master Fairy Yanxia, who forcefully used the Appearance-Alterning Spell to reveal her true face. In order to escape from their control, Su Luo destroyed Fairy Yanxia's cave and the spell, but she was also seriously injured and fell into the sea. Lifting the spell revealed her mysterious background. \n\nThe one who rescued her from the sea was actually her lover who assassinated her on Earth—Yun Qi. Shocked, Yun Qi revealed that he knew Su Luo's life secret and could tell her about it.\n\nDid Su Luo choose a shortcut for the secret about her past and go with Yun Qi who betrayed her, or will she return to her life with Nangong Liuyun? \n\n(Source: iQIYI; translated and edited)",
