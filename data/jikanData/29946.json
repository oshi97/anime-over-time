    "synopsis": "When an artist seeks to visualize a musical number, they can fulfill the desire by producing an animation to accompany the sound and rhythm. In this sequence, an assembly of wavy lines metamorphose to Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op. 36 - IV. Allegro molto,\" as performed by an orchestra. The lines seamlessly transform into many shapes and objects—such as musicians, instruments, animals, angels, and demons. This phantasmagoria is a true spectacle for the eyes and ears.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
