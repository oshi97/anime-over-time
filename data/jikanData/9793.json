    "synopsis": "The Second Europa War is being fought between Gallia and the East Europan Imperial Alliance, and a penal military unit known as the Nameless is on the run from both superpowers. Deemed rebels by Gallia and also a priority target of the Empire, the Nameless struggle to find their place in the raging war. To make matters worse, the company's tank driver, Gusurg, abandons them to fight for the Empire.\n \nAfter liberating a small town from the Empire, the Nameless come across Isara Welkin, an injured tank driver from Gallia's Squad 7. Isara explains to the Nameless' leader, Kurt Irving, that her squad is retreating from a failed raid and pleads for the Nameless to save them. They now face a difficult decision: remain in hiding, or redeem themselves only to aid the nation that marked them as traitors.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
