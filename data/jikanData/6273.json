    "synopsis": "Working since before WW2, UEDA Shoji pierced through amateurism, Then, in his picture world he takes, cuts and rearranges photos through his own sensibility, which takes him to the new media that is Ga-nime, encouraged by his friend the actor SANO Shiro, born in the same prefecture. The pictures used for this exhibition are not only from his most famous “Dune Mode” series, but also of many pre/post-war pictures of his birthplace, streetcars running in Tokyo, and traditional scene of Japan, through which a whole culture appears. \n\n(Source: Toei-anim.co.jp)",
