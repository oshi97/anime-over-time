    "synopsis": "The current government is seeking outsiders and granting them positions according to their abilities in order to update their backwards country and create a new world! Zuo Yunqi is just an ordinary young master, but to save his father, he disguises himself as an outsider to join the government.\n\nUnfortunately, his disguise is broken by a man hired specifically to identify who's a real outsider and who isn't. In their battle of wits, the two of them end up in many comedic situations and eventually become allies. As the two of them stop a shocking conspiracy, they discover that some of the outsiders have formed their own alliance to revolt against those in power and create a new society of peace and equality. Zuo Yunqi and his friends are forced to join in and become a part of this battle...\n\n(Source: Baidu)",
