    "synopsis": "It is three years after the legendary Prism Queen Cup, and Aira Harune, Rizumu Amamiya, and Mion Takamine have become famed Prism Stars, spreading the glamor and radiance of Prism Shows wherever they perform. However, they encounter an unexpected challenge from a passionate and lively girl, Mia Ageha, who has publicly declared her intent to defeat Aira and become the greatest Prism Star.\n\nSensing her potential, the Prism Show agency Pretty Top recruits Mia alongside three other aspiring Prism Stars—Karin Shijimi, Reina Miyama, and Ayami Ooruri—to form an idol group, Prizmmy. But the road to stardom is not easy: Mia has to deal with an old friend's unexpected appearance, this time as her rival, as well as navigate her way through the alluring yet conniving world of Prism Shows. Nevertheless, with her friends and team by her side, Mia is all the more fired up to march forward and carve the future for herself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "The main cast in the Pretty Rhythm franchise features fictional characters based on the real-life girl group Prizmmy. In April 2012, an existing arcade game Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream was relaunched as Pretty Rhythm: Dear My Future to coincide with its tie-in anime adaptation of the same name. Each episode of the anime series featured a live-action variety show segment titled \"Pretty Rhythm Studio\" featuring the members of Prizmmy.",
