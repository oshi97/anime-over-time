With countless travel destinations to choose from and as many preferences as there are club members, coming to an agreement seems far-flung.\n\nUnable to reach a decision, they remember that they must first apply for new passports. As simple as it may sound, the routine visit to a government office and filing a form soon turns into an all-day adventure for Yui Hirasawa and the rest of the band.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
