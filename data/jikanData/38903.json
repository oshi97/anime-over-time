    "synopsis": "Year TS 2XXX AD. Humanity has formed a \"relaxed world government.\" Everything was entrusted to the international AI network Sapientia, and people lived according to their rational judgment... However, Sapientia's \"moon reclamation project\" created a schism between the Earth—which maintains peace by sending pollutants and criminals to the moon—and the moon, which is forced to live in poverty, becoming a source of fire for the War of Independence.\n\nThe main character, Jack, who was involved in bombing terrorism, was robbed of his family one day by the Moon Rebels, who were plotting to liberate him from Earth. Jack, sworn to vengeance, decided to travel to the moon with his friends as an earth army investigator.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
