Now, Okko must live at her grandmother's traditional hot springs inn, which she is surprised to find is occupied by the ghost of a barefoot child. He encourages Okko to follow in her grandmother's footsteps and prepare to inherit the inn.\n\nInitially, Okko struggles to keep up with the responsibilities of the inn and the accommodation of guests. However, her parents told her that an inn is welcoming for everyone, and she strives to honor their memory. After discovering a few other spirits around the village, Okko learns that even though her parents are gone, she does not have to be lonely.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
