    "synopsis": "The quirky town is full of beautifully trimmed faces, and people use grooming as a measure of status and character. After their mother passed away, sister Ruoqing and younger brother Laiyong lived in the town dependent on each other. My sister works hard in the beauty salon, hoping to get everyone's approval and get the qualification for beauty treatment. However, the younger brother hated Xiurong and resisted alone. As a result, the conflict between siblings intensified.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",
