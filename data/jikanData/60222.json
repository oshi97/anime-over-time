    "synopsis": "DVD release of Keitai Shoujo.\n\nThis is about Hiro Aida and his friends. Their daily life at school and first romantic encounters with all the fun and confusion. All these people are connected to each other through cell phone messages.\n\nThe DVD release includes both the main segment from the streaming version and a dedicated epilogue for each episode, adding previously unaired epilogues for episodes 1, 3, and 4. \nEach episode totals about 12 minutes, with approximately one minute of new content in each episode aired without epilogues.\n\nUnlike the streaming version, where episode 6 served as a platform-specific epilogue, episode 6 on the DVD is simply a recap of the main segments from all five episodes, with no additional content.",
