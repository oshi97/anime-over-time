Unable to recall the memories of his life, he relies on the visitor to take him on a journey of discovery. Revealing everything—from their seven-year relationship to the emotional hardships they faced together—the two rekindle their bond severed by time. Behind this beautiful love story, however, lies a much darker truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
