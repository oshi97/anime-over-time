    "synopsis": "The animated short film that inspired the artist’s first PC and mobile game. Like its predecessors, the film shows distinctively satisfying timing and motions. A boy does sit-ups with a dog standing over him. Another dog runs across a boy’s back as he bends forward. The boy and the dog run out of breath, and so on—really. The plain yellow background accentuates the characters’ comical movements.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)",
