    "synopsis": "Truth and essence fade with too many people, too many things, too much information. As a result, many stop thinking and lose their imagination.\nThe constructed values ​​are saturated, and in order for a handful of things to survive, the unnecessary things exist as if they are necessary, and the rules and reasons for wasting them are defined.\n\nPeople who are just drifting away without realizing the values ​​that are being forced on them. Unconsciously or out of indifference. In a world of ambiguous circumstances, even though I know the shadow of prosperity that seeks abundance, I question it while being bound by the past. If you try to seek new thoughts, there is nothing there and you feel uneasy.\nIf you can turn your eyes to a new world from there.\n\n(Source: Official site)",
