What was left is his identity, a child whose eyes are provided by fishes, a child who lies down on the floor and head-butts his identity, a child who cannot say anything because of a zipper across his mouth. He undo the zipper but under it is another zipper...\nEcology and philosophy of  children with sadness and humour.\n\n(Source: Yamamura Animation)",
