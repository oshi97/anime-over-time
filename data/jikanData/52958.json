    "synopsis": "\"Forest and Trees\" is an installation of moving images and sounds employing 12 digital photo frames. The animation and its sound effects playing through the internal speakers of each frame gradually come together to form music. The work's title suggests the artist's interest in having the work received in a way that shifts recognition back and forth between the whole.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
