    "synopsis": "Thanks to their family's martial arts style, Jin Kazama and his mother, Jun, have had to overcome all sorts of challenges. But even with their strong bond, the two are no match for the terrifying demon that invades their home, harboring a bloodlust for Jun. Cornered by such a stubborn creature, Jun commands Jin to find his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, before she disappears along with the demon in an explosion.\n\nJin arrives at his grandfather's abode, only to be treated like a stranger from a different bloodline. However, upon discovering that Ogre was the demon behind the Kazamas' tragedy, Heihachi takes Jin under his tutelage and begins to train the young man rigorously. With a flaming vengeance, Jin turns his blood, sweat, and tears into strength for his fistsâ€”all for the sake of Ogre's demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
