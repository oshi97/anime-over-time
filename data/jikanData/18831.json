    "synopsis": "Following the release of their 8th album \"DUM SPIRO SPERO,\" Japanese rock band Dir en Grey went into hiatus following a vigorous touring schedule in Japan and abroad, a year and a half later returning with their single \"RINKAKU\" released on December 19th, 2012.  Once again animator Keita Kurosaka was enlisted to create a hand drawn music video, that in many regards is much less shocking and grotesque than the band's previous collaboration with Kurosaka, the infamous \"Agitated Screams of Maggots\" music video.",
