    "synopsis": "A lonely exchange student meets and falls in passionate love with a dancer. A girl who falls into madness when she learns her lover is going home to make his life.\n\nThe wanderings of youth on the stage of 19th century Berlin. The legendary novel of Meiji writer Mori Ogai, \"Maihime (dancing girl),\" adapted by Ga-nime \"School Girl\" producer Oku Shutaro who shows us his illustration talent and appoints Ms FURUYA Akisa for the booklets, slide shows, and animation of this Ga-nime. Over the background of a foreign country, we discover all the pathetic, poetic feelings of this elegant story as the wind of fresh artistic images brings it to life.\n\n(Source: Toei-Anim.co.jp)",
