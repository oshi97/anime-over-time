    "synopsis": "An unclothed woman wakes up in an unfamiliar and seemingly lifeless town, with no recollection of either her name or memories. Suddenly, words mysteriously appear on her hands and reveal her name: Agarta, the \"Devourer of Dragons.\" Puzzled, Agarta explores her surroundings in hopes of discovering the truth.\n\nAlong the way, Agarta encounters a grotesque creature, which constantly chases her. When she is about to lose all hope, Agarta hears a strangely familiar voice telling her not to flee. For Agarta to put an end to her misery, she must gather up the courage to confront the monster, as it might lead her to the missing piece of this enigma.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
