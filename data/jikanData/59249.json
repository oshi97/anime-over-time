    "synopsis": "Opening, Ending and Encore animations for Persona Music Live 2012.\n\nThe intro VTR starts off with a short recap of the events of the anime. From March 21, it fast forwards to April 8, the day of the concert. The Investigation Team, sans the protagonist and Teddie, are gathered in the Junes' Electronics department. Yosuke shows them a text message he received from Teddie telling them to come find him. They don their glasses and enter the TV World only to find the protagonist, Yu Narukami. A real life Teddie mascot appears on the stage to greet and blow kisses to the audience and explains the reason why he gathered the Team is because he wanted to have a solo concert. The Team finds the TV World filled with the audience. Teddie then explains the do's and don'ts's while in the concert hall and explains that since they're in the TV World, the concert can be broadcasted all over Japan. Teddie hypes up the crowd before the concert officially starts.\n\nThe Encore VTR is done in the style of TV channels. Teddie starts flipping through the channel so he can find the party, and while flipping through, we are given glimpses of the ordinary lives of various Social Links in Persona 4. It first starts with Nanako and Dojima at their home, the former singing the Junes' theme song before Dojima interrupts her to show her the letter they received from Yu. Teddie flips the channel to Kou, Daisuke and Ai at Aiya's, Aika serving them their beef bowls. Teddie flips the channel again to Margaret and Elizabeth inside the Velvet Room. Igor is absent and Elizabeth is singing the Long Nose Song. Margaret asks her what she's doing and Elizabeth responds that she's performing for the concert. She is interrupted from her singing when Teddie starts flipping through the channels much faster, showing glimpses of scenery from the anime. It briefly shows a closeup of Adachi in his cell before landing back on the Investigation Team. Teddie and the others rile up the audience once more for the encore.\n\nThe Ending VTR has the Investigation Team saying their goodbyes before leaving the TV World, and Teddie thanks the audience for coming to the concert. \n\n(Source: Megami Tensei Wiki)",
