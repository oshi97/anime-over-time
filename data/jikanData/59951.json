    "synopsis": "In the vast and wild fairyland, the culture of cultivating immortals prevails, and mortals are proud to become cultivators. College student, Lu Hangzhi,  transmigrated from the modern times and became a mortal servant in Ziyun Town. \n\nHe lived a life of treading on thin ice every day, but he refused to accept his fate and worked hard to get rid of his status quo and strived to get ahead. Later, because of a good deed, he was appreciated by Zhu Fuqin, the eldest lady of the Zhu Mansion, and his senior brother Leng Wuya. \n\nWith unremitting efforts, he passed many tests and joined the Xuanxin Sect. He was promoted from an outer disciple to an inner disciple, and was even favored by the deputy head Chen Ji and took him in. He cut his way through obstacles and moved forward on the road of cultivating immortals. \n\n(source: Qiyi)",
