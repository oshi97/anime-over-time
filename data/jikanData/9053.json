Facing extinction, some have decided to accept their doom and live to seek pleasure; others are still trying to use science to fight off that fate. In central Tokyo, one of the last inhabited areas in the world, these two groups face off in a struggle over a hidden sample of \"ICE,\" a substance that could save humanity.\n\n(Source: Seminal Films)",
