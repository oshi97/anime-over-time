    "synopsis": "As a young boy, Prince Oscar Lyeth Increatos Loz Farsas was cursed by the Witch of Silence, rendering it all but impossible for any woman to bear him a child. After 15 years of fruitlessly seeking a way to lift the spell, Oscar resorts to enlisting the help of a different witch. To this end, he heads to the Azure Tower, home of the Witch of the Azure Moon. Ascending the tower is no easy task; for decades, no one has overcome the array of traps, puzzles, and enemies designed to repulse any challengers. Oscar, however, easily climbs to the top, where he meets the fabled witch, Tinasha. To the prince's surprise, despite being hundreds of years old, Tinasha looks like a beautiful young woman in her late teens.\n\nOscar explains his circumstances to the witch, who quickly perceives the true nature of his affliction. Though she claims that undoing the spell would be tremendously difficult, Tinasha proposes a workaround—to find Oscar a partner capable of withstanding the curse's effects.\n\nRealizing that such a woman is right in front of his eyes, Oscar boldly tells the witch to marry him. Though he is promptly rejected, the young prince refuses to back down, and the two eventually reach an agreement: Tinasha will leave the tower and live with Oscar for the next year. As the two continue searching for a way to lift Oscar's curse, word of Tinasha's emergence from isolation spreads, catching the attention of all sorts of old acquaintances.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
