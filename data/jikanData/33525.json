    "synopsis": "In commemoration of the 150th year of its business, J.Walter Thompson Japan office created a 3D animation short film. This is a Christmas story for December, when the anniversary event took place.\n\nThe story theme is “Tokyo after 150 years.” It is a systemized, innocuous world with hopes and dreams taken away. Even Santa Clause is persecuted and does not exist.\n\nHowever, Santa Clause makes a comeback by many children’s wishes, and the world regains its shine again. In the end, there is a copy “Dreams to people in next 150 years. KEEP PIONEERING. JWT TOKYO”\n\nThrough the near-future Santa Clause, it expresses the will of the J. Walter Thompson Japan to never forget pioneering spirit at any time and create a world with hopes and dreams through communication.\n\n(Source: Official Website)",
