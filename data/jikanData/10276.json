    "synopsis": "Mini Theater 1\nSeishun Academy faces off against Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School in an unofficial rematch. Instead of playing tennis, the players end up getting distracted by a game of Acchi Muite Poi and a battle between whose data is superior.\n\nMini Theater 2\nMysterious love letters are appearing in shoe lockers at Seishun Academy. Sadaharu Inui sees this as a perfect opportunity to observe the regulars' response to receiving a love letter addressed to them.\n\nMini Theater 3\nSeiichi Yukimura asks his vice captain, Genichirou Sanada, to be the model for his next painting. Unfortunately, Sanada's reluctance doesn't seem to be doing anything for Yukimura's creativity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
