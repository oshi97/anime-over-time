The life necessity, such as electricity, water, and food are transported by the pipelines out from the Shibuya. The pipelines are running like cobweb in the sky, the young people in Shibuya looked like bugs trapped in the cobweb.\n\nIn this city, there are people called \"Prayers\".

They turn music into electric signals and inject them into brains, and destroy opponents' mind and bodies each others.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)\n\nOriginally created as 4-episode-OVA, it was canceled after 2 episodes.",
