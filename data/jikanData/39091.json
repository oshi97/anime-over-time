They tell stories from within the Ainu land and culture. These short films are featured at museums, schools, and film festivals--particularly \"The New Chitose Airport International Animation Festival\" who's celebrating Hokkaido's 150th anniversary (before the Boshin War the land was known as Ezochi and not formally a part of Japan). \n\nThe official YouTube channel provides various audio and subtitles combinations for the short films, roughly a year after their first showcase. And the yearly films are also released on DVD.",
