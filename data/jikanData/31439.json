But what happens when he isn't around? \n\nFor the student council, consisting of otaku president Kaoruko Rokuonji; headstrong Ashe Rufflette Sakuragi; quiet computer programmer Toa Narumi; and Toa's best friend, the impish Mihiro Miyase, it means they will have to keep themselves entertained. Wagamama High Spec offers a glimpse into the girls' lives as they get into amusing—and sometimes risqué—hijinks at their school and around town.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
