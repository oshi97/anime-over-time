    "synopsis": "In a town of South-East Asia, at night, a Yakuza is facing a bloody conflict with local gangs. During the fight, he encounters with a ghost called Krasue (pronounced Gasoo), a flying woman head with her guts exposed, and is followed by her because of his blood's taste. Their battle eventually leads them to the depth of a dark and damp maze-like jungle, where boundaries between humans, animals and ghost seem to fade. With a howling noise, \"BOY MEETS GIRL\" metamorphoses into \"Encounter with another species.\"\n\n(Source: New Chitose Airport International Animation Festival)",
