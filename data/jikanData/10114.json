As a result Kisanta, who received an assignment meant for a sixth year, has gone missing after trying to sneak into Oomagatoki Castle to steal their lord's fundoshi. A group including Shinbei and Kirimaru is sent to rescue him, but since Oomagatoki is at war with Tasogaredoki Castle it might be a difficult mission. \n\nAt the same time, Ninjutsu Academy receives a request for support from a village troubled by the war, and Rantarou and the remaining students and teachers head there to help out.",
