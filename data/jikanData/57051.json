Godzilla appears to challenge him, equally unfazed by the military's attacks, and they battle in a city. As four more Gigans arrive, Godzilla unleashes his atomic breath.\n\n(Source: Wikizilla)",

It was uploaded to the GEMSTONE YouTube channel on March 20, 2019, and became one of the six prize-winners, a group which included Godziban.
