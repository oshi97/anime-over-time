    "synopsis": "We researched a barber shop that existed for 80 years in Arakawa Ward, Tokyo, which no longer exists, and created a set that looks just like the real thing. \n\nA fantasy involving an ordinary family in a setting full of nostalgia. The Takada family, which runs Takata Barber Shop in downtown Tokyo, is a family of four: parents, an older sister in junior high school, and a younger brother in elementary school. Due to the pranks of the Seven Lucky Gods who live in this barber shop, strange events occur in the Takada family's daily life.\n\n(Source: Amazon Prime, translated)",
