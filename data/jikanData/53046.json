    "synopsis": "A married man on a business trip stays at a hotel late at night. The boss's daughter, Kungcher, falls in love with him at first sight and sneaks into the room to confess his love. The next day, the man leaves, and despite her father's opposition, Kungcher goes out in pursuit of him. She arrives at the pier in a drizzle, only to see the man boarding the boat immediately and not looking back. When the boat was about to leave, Kungcher panicked and jumped into the river, unfortunately drowning, the river instantly changed color and set off huge waves!\n\n(Source: Movie Douban, translated)",
