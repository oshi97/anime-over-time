Shaleen was the last ICHIRIN-SHA (unicyclist) in the world, traveling the world on his beat up motor unicycle. One day, when Shaleen was running from the attacks of the missile mechanoids, he stops by a ghost town and meets a mysterious girl who was constantly targeted by the mechanoids.\n\nNote: Originally meant to be a full length movie, the project was cancelled, but a 7 minutes long trailer was released before that.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
