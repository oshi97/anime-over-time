    "synopsis": "Once shunned by the art world, Perception Art has taken the world by storm. The medium has evolved to incorporate all five senses, allowing viewers to completely immerse themselves in pieces of art. As the son of the creators of this movement, Kazuya Yamanashi has inherited his late parents' talent and creativity for Perception Art. Now enrolled at Eisen High School, the first-year has his sights set on becoming the best Perception Artist.\n\nKazuya has a reason besides ambition to attend this prestigious institution, as he hopes to make amends with his estranged childhood friend, third-year student Kyou Takise. But the rift between them may be difficult to repair since Kyou and Kazuya belong to different streams of study at the school.\n\nAs luck would have it, the two are partnered for the exclusive Staircaser competition, in which the winners will represent Eisen for the year. In order to stand a chance against their competitors, Kazuya and Kyou will have to learn to set aside their differences first.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
