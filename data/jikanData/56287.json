    "synopsis": "Although Lusasa Town may look just like any other town, it's an alternative reality. The lives of the characters are very similar to those of people on Earth. The characters act just like humans. The residents are adorable and naughty. They have emotions, friends, goals and ideals; and they love to gossip, just like us. What happens at Lusasa Town are all the little things in life that we are familiar with.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
