As soon as Arnold places the puppets within, they spontaneously come to life, beginning their improvisational performances. What might the fan letters from the puppets contain? Why does a fragrant signature dish lead to chaos? In an unusually intense soccer match, the score difference reaches...?!\nMore exciting stories await at the Krakow Theater!\nThe capricious and lively Joker, the narcissistic and grumpy Leo, and the self-absorbed and clueless Bane, along with other residents of the manor, will join hands to showcase a series of fantastic and joyful daily routines for the audience.",
