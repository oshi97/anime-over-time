    "synopsis": "Aira Harune, a clumsy yet happy-go-lucky girl, is suddenly dragged into the popular world of Prism Shows—an idol show based on figure skating, where performers called \"Prism Stars\" wear outfits encased in Prism Stones and perform stylistic Prism Jumps. Captivated by the dazzling fashion and gorgeous Prism Jumps, Aira decides to become a Prism Star herself.  \n\nShe soon encounters the hot-headed Rizumu \"Rhythm\" Amamiya, who desires to perform the legendary Prism Jump “Aurora Rising”; as well as the prideful Mion Takamine, who dreams of becoming the brightest Prism Star above the rest. The journey of these girls is marked by friendship, growth, and unexpected encounters. Can they perform Prism Jumps high enough to reach their dreams and become the next Prism Queens?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream is based on Tomy Company Ltd.'s 2010 arcade game Pretty Rhythm: Mini Skirt. The arcade game was relaunched under the same title as the anime on April 28, 2011 to tie in with the show's release. The series' premiere was delayed one week from April 2, 2011 to April 9, 2011 due to the 2011 Touhoku Earthquake.",
