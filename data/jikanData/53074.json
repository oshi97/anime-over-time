    "synopsis": "Finding her life in the Lost City of Atlantis too boring, friendly but impulsive shark girl Gura Gawr swims to shore in search of fun. However, she soon finds out that she cannot enjoy life on the surface peacefully without clothes. Luckily, the nearby Blue Axolotl Beachwear shop presents Gura with a shark-themed outfit that speaks to her inner child.\n\nThanks to a flier posted for a Hololive Production audition, Gura has since become the internet's most beloved VTuber. But that has never stopped her origin story from being any less lovable than her YouTube antics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Sharkâ€™d premiered at the beginning of a musical livestream, \"SHARK 3D LIVE!,\" on the official Gura Gawr YouTube channel. Shortly after, the animation was uploaded as a standalone video to the channel. The short features references to and cameos of other Hololive Production idols. Tonari Animation, the studio commissioned by Hololive Production to animate the short, uploaded a behind-the-scenes video to their YouTube channel showcasing the animation process.",
