    "synopsis": "Film about the ''Sick building syndrome'', it won multiple awards including the 2015 Urban Nomad Film Festival's Best Animation award.\n\nIt is a city without memories, but a growing maze with construction sites, skyscrapers, advertising billboards that keeps taking over or being taken over their domains. Citizens wander around and eventually get lost in vain, and the Mô-sîn-á is the only one to lead their way.\n\n(Source: Creator's Vimeo account)",
