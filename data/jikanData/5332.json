    "synopsis": "Despite being around a decade older than her, Library Task Force (LTF) member Mikihisa Komaki has been friends with Marie Nakazawa, a girl from his neighborhood, ever since she was little. Their relationship perseveres through thick and thin, and when Marie suddenly develops a hearing impairment during her middle school days, Komaki is there to support her—often by selecting books for her enjoyment.\n\nBut one fateful morning, Komaki finds himself arrested by the Media Betterment Committee, which charges him with invading the privacy of a minor due to the supposedly insensitive content of one of his recommended novels. Knowing that what awaits their friend at the \"inquiry\" is more akin to torture, the members of the LTF look for ways to save Komaki before it is too late.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
