    "synopsis": "Takuma Kosugi is an office worker who does not have enough time to take care of everything at home. To make his daily life easier, he purchases a secondhand housekeeping robot named Mina, who quickly proves her worth. One day, after returning from work and having one too many beers, Takuma somewhat jokingly blurts out that she should become his wife! Much to his surprise, Mina takes his words seriously, and the two gradually begin living as if they are married.\n\nAs the days go by, Takuma and Mina grow closer and start doing more activities together, like going on a picnic and spending a day at the beach. However, much of society still considers human-robot relationships unusual. The couple must figure out if their arrangement can succeed and how to convince the people around them of their sincerity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
