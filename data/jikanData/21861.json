    "synopsis": "A test subject is administered daily medication by a nurse in a ward where mysterious medical experiments take place. One day, when the nurse presses the switch of the test subject, it successfully transforms into a chimera. When the test subject continues to hold human desires to take on non-human forms, what spectacle will arise as a result? And what effect will this have on the subject's relationship with the nurse?\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)",
    "background": "Airy Me is inspired by Cuushe's 2009 song of the same name. The animation also features her 2013 song \"Steamy Mirror.\" Yoko Kuno created Airy Me from 3,000 still images drawn over almost two years. Images were drawn with colored pencils and crayon and edited with Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. It received the Animation Division New Face Award at the 17th Japan Media Arts Festival.",
