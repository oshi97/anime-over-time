    "synopsis": "Includes four shorts.\n\nEpisode 1 - Ton Ton Ton To:\n\nOne day, Pig is waiting for the bus. I've been waiting for a long time, but the bus doesn't come. Then, Buta-kun went up to the rooftop of the building over there along the electric wire with \"Tontonton\", and was caught in a balloon and went to the sky. It was a fantasy world that Pig envisioned.\n\nEpisode 2 - Minna ga Oshiete Kuremashita:\n\nThere are many things that children do not know in the world, and adults teach us various things. A walk, a nap, in the soil or at night. Children learn a lot. But who can tell us what adults don't tell us?\n\nEpisode 3 - Ittadeshou:\n\nParents and children of horses walking on the road. Whenever she discovers something dangerous, the horse's mom pays attention to her girl horse. She doesn't listen to the foal, though. If you pay attention to \"I will stumble\", the foal will fall, \"I stumbled!\". She screams that her mother said, \"You're right.\"\n\nEpisode 4 - Tomodachi ga Imashita:\n\nWhen the butterfly is flying, you will meet various friends such as flowers, cows, tomatoes, scarecrows and bees. Every time, the butterfly greets \"Hello!\". The butterfly flies fluffy while greeting each other cheerfully. Who will you meet next?\n\n(Source: U-NEXT)",
