Their worlds should never have crossed, but they join hands to solve a bloody mystery. In the darkest of nights, Lynn finds herself in desperate need of help. Then she wanders into the mysterious city of \"Lügenberg,\" where non-humans live.\n\nLynn's world changes drastically when she encounters \"Arne,\" a vampire who is called \"the worst\" in the city. And tonight, a new \"murder case\" has occurred. What is the truth behind the bizarre incidents that take place in a world where humanity and the bizarre intersect?\n\n\"Come on, human. You may dance merrily under the crimson moon.\" \n\n(Source: Steam, edited)",
