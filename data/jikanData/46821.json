    "synopsis": "Ning Chen, a Haoyue guard of the empire's first princess, has never been able to develop his cultivation skills until he awakens a special ability that allows him to devour metals. This greatly increases his cultivation speed to levels beyond those of regular cultivators, much to their disbelief. As a guard for the empire, he constantly removes usurpers from the imperial capital, quelling rebellions as they form. In order to maintain peace and support his princess, Ning Chen must find ways to further increase his cultivation levels to take down the enemies that stand in his way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
