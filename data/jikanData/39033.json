    "synopsis": "A studio DLE collaboration with the Tokyo Metropolitan government, aims to improve Tokyoites' public manners and regard for others. \n\nThree total videos were made and released on the same day.\n\nOne video reminds viewers that the Olympics and Paralympics are coming to Tokyo in five years and exhorts them to make Japan \"something they can be proud of.\" The campaign emphasizes that adults behave well, because they will set a good example for children, and \"when children change, the future will change too.\" \n\nAnd another video introduces the series' main characters, Animal Hamaguchi (a former pro wrestler), and his daughter, Kyouko Hamaguchi (a current pro wrestler), who chide a woman for not returning children's greetings. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
