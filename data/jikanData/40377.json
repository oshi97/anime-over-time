    "synopsis": "Astro Boy appears to be a normal, playful kid, yet he is a robot capable of both flying and incredible strength. Living with his parents in a small town where humans and robots coexist, he has many friends thanks to his cheerful nature. Eager to learn and try new things, Astro and his companions often embark on exciting adventures. But their explorations are met with unexpected troubles when the wicked criminal Hamegg—joined by his accomplices Gora, a pink gorilla robot, and Professor Flau—interferes with their endeavors. \n\nAs the little robot boy and his group bravely face challenges, their efforts become part of a journey to discover the world's values and wonders.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Robot Atom, also known as Little Astro Boy, is an Astro Boy franchise anime television spin-off series produced by Tezuka Productions and Yomiuri TV Enterprises in partnership with the Nigerian broadcaster Channels TV. As an international co-production, three Nigerian animators traveled to Japan to animate two sequences. Makoto Tezuka spearheaded the international focus, which was partly made as a response to declining birth rates in Japan and in hopes of receiving an endorsement from the Cool Japan initiative. Described as \"edutainment,\" Robot Atom ran in English on Channels TV's children's block of programming between March 22, 2014 and April 26, 2014. A bilingual DVD was later released in Japan on November 3, 2015. While the show was not aired anywhere else, it received positive feedback in Nigeria.",
