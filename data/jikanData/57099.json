    "synopsis": "In any competitive cheerleading contest, it is almost certain that Kanata Misora is going to be the star of the show. As a member of the winning squad in Japan's middle school cheerleading nationals, she joins Takanozaki Prefectural High School with her friend Megumi Kaionji intending to seek glory once more. However, following an incident at a competition, she loses touch with her talents and never returns to the club for practice.\n\nWhile despondent, Kanata ends up spotting internet sensation Suzuha Obunai parkouring with an impressive level of athleticism and ends up befriending her in the process. Through Suzuha, Kanata meets Anna Aveiro and Nodoka Ootani, as well as Suzuha's classmate Tanizaki Shion—each carrying their own talents that apply to competitive cheerleading. Gathering through sheer coincidence, the six girls now work together and cheer each other on to chase their unique dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
