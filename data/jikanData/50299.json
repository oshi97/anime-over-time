Unfortunately though, his various attempts to help his sick mother and prove himself to the villagers only seem to backfire. One day, following a perilous encounter, Xiuyuan learns that he is in fact the reincarnation of the great hero Dragon Slaying Luohan. He also discovers that his father once protected him by stealing a sacred golden artefact for the evil Jin Ling. As his powers begin to awaken, Xiuyuan finally knows what he has to do to become a true hero.\n\n(Source: IMDB)",
