    "synopsis": "Tanis, a child genius, is the youngest son of two mad scientists. His family has spent their lives withdrawn from normal society living on an isolated island, where the couple conducts experiments on Tanis' siblings that result in them gaining abnormal abilities. However, this activity is put to a stop when they are caught and arrested.\n\nTanis is brought by government officials to a more populated island, alongside his four siblings: Snow, a dog-human hybrid; Ashise, a plant-human hybrid; Aisley, a spider-human hybrid; and Suishi, a mind-reader. Being the only one who has not been genetically modified, Tanis takes on the responsibility of adapting his siblings to society, all while trying to conceal their' distinctive characteristics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Shiyan Pin Jiating, also know as The Frankenstein Family, is based on the ongoing manhua series (Chinese manga) of the same name, created by Yanai, a manhuajia from Hong Kong. The series is published by Sun Comics (Rigeng Jihua), who also collaborated with Tencent Penguin Pictures and Phoenix Animation (Dahuoniao Donghua) on the anime adaptation. In an added segment in the original manhua, creator Yanai states that the ideas for the characters originated from a group drawing project in middle school, which he then further refined. There is currently no North American company licensed to carry this production.",
