    "synopsis": "Arriving in Japan, underground golfer Eve wants nothing more than to play a match against Aoi Amawashi, the \"Innocent Tyrant\" prodigy that caught her eye. However, the girls, wishing to finally settle the score on who is the better golfer, will have to wait until the conclusion of the All-Japan Girls' High School Gold Doubles Championship. Now competing together for the Raiou Girls' Academy's golf team, Eve and Aoi decide to work together to claim a win for their institution.\n\nFor a chance at defeating their more challenging opponents, both girls must find a way to further develop their golfing styles. However, dangerous figureheads pull strings in the background, making this high school golf tournament much more serious than it appears. In addition, Eve's illusive past resurfaces, making matters between her and Aoi even more complicated than they already were.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
