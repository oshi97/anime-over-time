    "synopsis": "Kazuya Kujou is a foreign student at Saint Marguerite Academy, a luxurious boarding school in the Southern European country of Sauville. Originally from Japan, his jet-black hair and dark brown eyes cause his peers to shun him and give him the nickname \"Black Reaper,\" based on a popular urban legend about the traveler who brings death in the spring.\n\nOn a day like any other, Kujou visits the school's extravagant library in search of ghost stories. However, his focus soon changes as he becomes curious about a golden strand of hair on the stairs. The steps lead him to a large garden and a beautiful doll-like girl known as Victorique de Blois, whose complex and imaginative foresight allows her to predict their futures, now intertwined.\n\nWith more mysteries quickly developing—including the appearance of a ghost ship and an alchemist with the power of transmutation—Victorique and Kujou, bound by fate and their unique skills, have no choice but to rely on each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "The 11th episode of Gosick was originally scheduled for broadcast on March 19, but had to be postponed to April 2 due to emergency broadcast related to the devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The anime again met some trouble when Bandai Entertainment stopped releasing new DVDs, cancelling the series’ scheduled US DVD/Blu-ray release.",
