As the last bee of the cat world, he invites Tamala on a magical journey back in time—back to our near future. \n\nWith Tamala's era quickly approaching, civilization has begun to waste and destroy the nature that lie around them. Roving around a land where all other animals are extinct, she finally begins to starve.. Until Kuronosuke offers himself as food. \n\n(Source: Official site, edited)",
