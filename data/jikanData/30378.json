It will be between 10 to 15 minutes long and will adapt the events of the first volume.\n\n(Source: MAL News)\n\nThe hero and author of Sanzoku Diary is Okamoto Kentarou. When he was young, he lived out in the country, and he knew an old man who was a hunter. In 2009, Kentarou was inspired to leave Tokyo and return to Okayama Prefecture to become a hunter himself. Using an air rifle and traps, Kentarou hunts, prepares, and eats various animals. The manga covers all his hunting-related activities in close detail. \n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
