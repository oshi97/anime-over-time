The great earthquake and tsunami had changed their destinies. Their lives were saved, but they were perplexed when asked about their identities at an evacuation site. It was an old woman named Kiwa Yamana who lent them a helping hand. From that day, Yurie was known as Yui, Moeka as Hiyori, and together with Kiwa, the three women began a wonderful communal life together at the old house \"Mayoiga\" overlooking the sea.",
