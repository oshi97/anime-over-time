Knowing their pursuers are not far behind, the three embark on a journey to locate Kanna's mother, who Kanna yearns to see after many years of separation. Amid the tensions, the trio explores the world outside the confines of the palace—serving as a tranquil yet temporary distraction from what is to come.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
