    "synopsis": "When Yohan is nine years old, he, his mother and sister are forcibly relocated to a notoriously cruel political prison camp in North Korea.  His innocence is gradually eroded by the harsh brutality of the camp, while the rest of his family tries to maintain their decency and compassion for their fellow humans.  Years later, after being devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of a loved one, he begins to reassess the meaning of his life - even as he struggles to survive in the worst imaginable living conditions.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
