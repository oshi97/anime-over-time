    "background": "Luger Code 1951 began as a story idea that Haruto Haneki submitted for the Shounen Jump+ × Animax Anime Scenario Award contest (少年ジャンプ＋×アニマックス アニメシナリオ大賞). The theme of the contest was \"your original scenario in the image of Shounen Jump.\" The contest accepted unpublished entries that could be made into a short anime, 30 to 40 minutes in estimated length. Haneki's scenario won the Grand Prize, winning him 2 million yen, a manga adaptation on Shounen Jump+, and an anime adaptation. Akira Akatsuki, who was one of the judges in the competition, drew the manga. The anime premiered on the Shonen Jump+ website on October 14 at 12:00 a.m. (effectively October 15 at midnight). The anime also ran on the Hikari TV service on October 15 at 8:00 p.m. and on the Animax channel on October 22 at 8:00 p.m. A making-of video aired alongside the anime as a special.",
