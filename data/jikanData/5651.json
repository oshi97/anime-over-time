Her mother, Sayoko, is a famous fashion designer and has scored a job for the family to shoot a TV production, a rare opportunity for the family to be together and enjoy themselves. The girls travel to a small, isolated village in late August and the filming begins. Little do Miu and her family know however, the entire production is a scheme. This is the time for a local festival and they happened to unwillingly volunteer to be a key figure for this festival; the Shishigami. One by one, the girls are subjected to the traditions of the festival, experiencing first-hand just how serious it is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
