    "synopsis": "Fifty years ago, the martial arts world was suddenly invaded by \"chaos.\" Murong Qiong formed a demon sect to fight against it, but they could not win despite the hard battle. The messenger of God Yi Zhihua came and taught everyone the demonization skills to successfully defeat the chaos. But the messenger of God left, and the demonization skills were introduced into the martial arts world and got out of control. Murong Qiong was disappointed and retired. His subordinate Yu Huabing took the opportunity to take over, improved the demonization skills, and created the punk invigoration era, making the martial arts world prosperous, but the price was that the martial artists all became \"superior martial arts monsters.\" Dongfang Sheng, a young man with a pure heart, found Murong Qiong who had retired to the Xiangxi Hotel, hoping to rely on him to restore the former glory of the martial arts world. Thus this ridiculous story begins...\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
