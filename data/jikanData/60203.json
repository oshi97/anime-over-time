    "synopsis": "This is the story of Wales-born C. W. Nicol who restored Japan's desolate forests. Nicol was involved with nature all over the world, including Arctic exploration and the creation of national parks in Ethiopia. He came to Japan, fascinated by the biodiversity of the country, with its drift ice to the north and coral reefs to the south. However, what he saw there were virgin forests being cut down one after another for economic reasons, and rivers being hardened with concrete. After learning that the Afan Argoed Forest Park in Wales had been restored by human hands, Nicol decided to create forests with his own hands to restore nature in Japan. He dreamed of the forests 100 years from now, which he would never be able to see.\n\n(Source: Official site, translated)",
