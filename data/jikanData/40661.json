    "synopsis": "After the devils see a television advertisement for Chitose, Hokkaido, Yurine Hanazono suggests that they all take a trip there. Everyone readily agrees to the excursion except for Jashin-chan; however, she is forced to tag along under the threat of Yurine's chainsaw.\n\nAs the group begins to wrap up their sightseeing for the day, Jashin-chan accidentally lets a stray deer eat the ticket they need to check in to their hotel. Coincidentally, the fallen angels are also on a Hokkaido trip and happen to be staying at the same hotel. Running into them, Jashin-chan has no choice but to initiate a battle for the angels' ticket by racing around Lake Shikotsu.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
