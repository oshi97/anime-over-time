    "synopsis": "A recent uptick in civilian riots and crimes has been observed across the country following the conclusion of the second Division Rap Battle. To make matters more chaotic, the individuals perpetrating the crimes have no recollection of the incidents nor any reason to be committing them in the first place. Suspecting these events to be linked to the effect of the Hypnosis Microphones, the governing Party of Words begins investigating the whereabouts of the mastermind behind them.\n\nThese cases have been more frequent in the six divisions, and their respective leaders are scrambling to find a way to prevent further havoc. But when the culprit pulling the strings threatens their territories with more calamity, the six leaders must put aside their personal differences and work together to stop this mayhem.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
