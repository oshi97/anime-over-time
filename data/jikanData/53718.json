    "synopsis": "This hand-drawn animation thematizes what we are looking at in everyday life. Created using pencils, pastels, and oil paints, the drawn pictures were then shot with a digital camera and spliced together as video. Set on a fantasy train representing a kind of mental landscape, a young man shuts himself off from the outside world by reversing his face so he does not see anything, while another man silently stuffs garbage into the face.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)",
