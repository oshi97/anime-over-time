    "synopsis": "Ken Kaneki has finally come to accept the monstrous, flesh-craving part of himself that he has feared and despised for so long. After escaping captivity and torture, Kaneki joins Aogiri Tree—the very militant ghoul organization that had abducted him, leading his friends to question his true motive and loyalty.\n\nAs tension between the government and the ghouls continues to rise, the Commission of Counter Ghoul, the government's specialized anti-ghoul agency, has intensified their efforts to completely purge Tokyo of ghouls. This threatens the transient peace of Kaneki's friends and former comrades—the ghouls at the Anteiku coffee shop. Aware of the dangerous situation, Kaneki faces several battles that puts his precious fleeting humanity on the line.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Both the Tokyo Ghoul manga and Tokyo Ghoul √A anime concluded with the same last arc, but how the anime arrived at that ending diverged greatly from the source material. Besides changing the ending fight scene and the main major plot of the manga, which was the focus of many chapters in the manga, Tokyo Ghoul √A also features a watered-down and greatly changed version of the source manga's final arc. Episode 1 was previewed at a screening at TOHO Cinemas, Nihonbashi on January 4, 2015. Regular broadcasting began on January 9, 2015.",
