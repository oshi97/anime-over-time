    "synopsis": "The film takes a simple idea—creating a picture using a simple thread—and transforms it into an engaging flow of animated images. From East Asian folklore, Okushita takes the symbol of the red string of fate. There are many variations of this ancient tale, but the main idea is that the gods tie men and women together who are destined as each other's soul mates together with a red thread.\n\nAn invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet,\nregardless of time, place, or circumstance.\nThe thread may stretch or tangle, but it will never break.\n-ancient Chinese belief\n\n(Source: Nishikata Film Review)",
