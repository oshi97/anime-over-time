    "synopsis": "99.419 Saisun\nWith 50 days remaining until the Seishou Festival, the girls have their measurements taken for their costumes. Comparing herself to Mahiru Tsuyuzaki and Nana Daiba, Futaba Isurugi wishes that she was taller, believing a few extra centimeters would allow her to play other roles. Seeing Futaba's apprehension, Hikari Kagura is reminded of a story about a stage girl who—in spite of her short stature—rose to brilliance.\n\n99.419 Touron\nJunna Hoshimi walks into a passionate exchange between Hikari and Maya Tendou regarding the portrayal of Claire, one of the lead roles in the play Starlight. While Hikari and Maya have their own beliefs about how the character should be depicted, the three all come to acknowledge their ambition to be under the limelight of the stage.\n\n99.419 Kaien   \nOn the opening day of the anticipated performance, Hikari is unexpectedly nervous. Having predicted such an outcome, the rest of the girls quickly work together to assist in her final preparations. Meanwhile, Karen Aijou swings for the fences to surprise Hikari with a gift.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
