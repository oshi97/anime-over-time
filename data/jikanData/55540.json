    "synopsis": "A film by Lu Jiawei, it was nominated at the 2004 Taipei Film Awards in the category ''Best Animation of the Year''.\n\nIt mainly talks about habits, addictions, dependence, and side effects. Human beings seek solace and healing in an all-encompassing way, which over time becomes habit, creates a state of dependence, and then becomes a ritual. Rituals are always more symbolic than practical. So human beings are engaged in symbolic behavior, without much substantive meaning and causing side effects.\n\n(Source: Taiwan Film &amp; Culture Association, translated)",
