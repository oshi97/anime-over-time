    "synopsis": "Due to the advent of modern technology, kids have abandoned their crayons and paper for electronic tablets, causing the imaginative energy emitted from children's doodles to reach an all-time low. Consequently, the Rakuga Kingdom in the sky, powered by such energy, is now at risk of collapsing onto the cities below. For any hope to avoid such a catastrophe, the kingdom's princess hastily seeks out a hero from Earth capable of wielding the \"Miracle Crayon.\" \n\nWhile the kingdom's reformers arrive on land to seize Earth, the magical crayon finds itself in the hands of Shinnosuke \"Shin-chan\" Nohara. In a journey that will test the limits of childlike imagination, Shin-chan must harness his creativity to secure the safety of his home and restore peace to both worlds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
