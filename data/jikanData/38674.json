    "synopsis": "Higashi Asia Buka Toshi is a yearly event in agreement with Japan, China, and Korea's cultural ministries. A city or ward from each country is chosen to bring awareness to that city through its arts and culture. For 2019, Japan selected its Toshima ward of Tokyo city. This means that Toshima is now accepting any projects, logos, public relations, school projects, etc. among the Toshima citizens and businesses to create a Toshima-portfolio and tourism for the ward.\n\nTo mark the debut of Toshima's selection, a rotocoped short was released following a little girl's view of Toshima's attractions.",
