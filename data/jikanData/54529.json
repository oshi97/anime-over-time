The Great Monk Zhen carried forward the Dharma for Dongdu. After five failures, including the death of his disciples, the obstruction of the government, and even blindness in both eyes, etc., he still did not change his ambition. He combined the then prosperous Chinese Buddhism with Chinese medicine, art, and architecture, literature, etc., were transmitted to Japan by water. Monk Jianzhen not only introduced precepts to complete the Japanese Vinaya sect, but also indirectly influenced the rise of two masters in the history of Japanese Buddhism—Kukairen of Shingon and Saicheng Master of Tendai Sect, and thus developed the development of Japanese Buddhism in the Heian and Ikura periods. Heyday. In terms of cultural influence, the architecture, sculpture, calligraphy, painting, medicine and even people's daily necessities introduced by the master Dongdu left the Tang culture with a precious and rich heritage in Japan. That is why Monk Jianzhen was praised as the \"giant of balance culture\" in Japan. Through the presentation of animation, this film hopes to introduce the public to understand the life of a generation of masters.\n\n(Source: Baidu Encyclopedia, translated)",

When he finally succeeded on his sixth attempt he had lost his eyesight as a result of his hardship. (Source: AniDB)",
