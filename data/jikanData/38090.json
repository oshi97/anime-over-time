    "synopsis": "A music video created for the Sophie brand of Unicharm Co., Ltd. which manufacturers feminine hygiene products. The video features a song completely in English with Japanese subtitles. As stated by the company president, Takahisa Takahara, is that women spend 6 yrs and 9 months menstruating their entire lives. With advancing gender roles and longer lifespans, more women are staying in the work place and having more periods. Mensuration causes hormonal mood swings like that of a cranky edgy prickly hedgehog, starving craving hungry black bear, fragile crying [bloated] elephant, and reclusive lonely lion. These are normal changes and the women are still themselves. It promotes body positivity and how women shouldn't be brushed off in the work place if they are having an effect from a biological function that they have to go through for 6 yrs and 9 months.",
