    "synopsis": "Galo Sengen (\"Galish Man GAL\" in English / GAL男宣言 in Japanese) is a 2011 rap music video by the Japanese hip-hop group Policeman.\n\nThe animated music video became well-known for its humorous depiction of a Japanese youth culture known as \"Gyaruo,\" which is characterized by the dark tanned skin, dyed blond hair and appreciation for dance music. \n\nIn the video, a group of men are satirically portrayed as Super Saiyans, a type of superfighters from the Japanese manga franchise Dragon Ball, who transcend into the state of \"galish\" or \"gyaru,\" a slang term derived from the Japanese pronunciation of English word \"girl.\"\n\n(Source: knowyourmeme)",
