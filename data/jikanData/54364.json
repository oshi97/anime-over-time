When a jellyfish monster from the sea tried to harm the newborn Mo Niang, the spirit manifested and chased it away. During the struggle, the jellyfish monster knocks down a candlestick and sets fire to the curtains. Although the family put it out immediately, it still frightened Mo Niang and she began to hold a deep fear towards fire from then on.",
