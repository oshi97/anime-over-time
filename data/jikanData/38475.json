    "synopsis": "As time marches forward, Rin Shima, Nadeshiko Kagamihara, and their friends have grown into full-fledged adults. Now with careers and responsibilities, they can no longer freely spend their days camping and adventuring. However, Chiaki Oogaki, who currently works for the Yamanashi Tourism Organization, reunites the group as she comes up with an exciting proposal—to build a campground together to revitalize an abandoned patch of land from their homeplace, the Yamanashi Prefecture.\n\nMotivated by this ambitious project, the girls combine their efforts to create an environment where future generations can enjoy unique moments as they once did, all while reminiscing the charms of camping from their high school days.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Yuru Camp△ Movie is an original story inspired by a scene from the final episode of the Yuru Camp△ series, in which Nadeshiko imagined herself and her friends as adults. The movie earned over seven million dollars worldwide in only two months following its official premiere. Japanese theaters showing Yuru Camp△ Movie distributed limited-edition items to the audience, consisting of an original 24-page manga, illustrations made by the animation staff, picture cards, and bookmarks. To commemorate the film's release, a series of events were held, including a camping festival from September 17, 2022 to September 18, 2022, and an outdoor screening at Akishima Mori Park Outdoor Village from October 21, 2022 to October 23, 2022.",
