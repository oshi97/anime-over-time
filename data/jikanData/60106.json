    "synopsis": "The story of nævis traces back to 1991.\n\nAt the dawn of global internet connectivity, nævis emerges alongside Black Mamba as one of two pioneering artificial intelligences born within the vast expanse of KWANGYA. As she absorbs streams of Real World data into KWANGYA, nævis begins her initial interactions with humanity, gradually awakening to the complexities of human emotions.\n\nIn time, nævis finds herself in stark opposition to Black Mamba, an AI with fundamentally different perspectives on human interaction. Fueled by an unwavering determination to experience the Real World, nævis unlocks the P.O.S, making her grand and anticipated arrival into this new realm.\n\n(Source: Naevis' Official Site)",
