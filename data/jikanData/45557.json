    "synopsis": "Optimums, a terrorist organization, maintains an oppressive regime over Sacco City—a place where thousands of immigrants reside. Since they came into power a year ago, the organization has enacted new laws and reclassified the immigrants from the far east as East Refugees.\n\nHe Jiang is a hot-tempered girl who travels alongside her father, He Chang Feng, as he delivers goods across Sacco City in their truck. One day, the Klee—a military police force—apprehends both for being in possession of a sword. In the ensuing struggle, He Chang Feng is shot dead while his daughter is imprisoned for eight years.\n\nFinally released from prison at the age of 24, He Jiang, with the help of her new friends, finds her abandoned truck and repairs it. As she begins delivering goods around the city once more, she faces various hurdles. With the Department of Security discriminating against her and the other East Refugees, He Jiang is forced to fight back, but she will need to gain more allies if she wants to stand a chance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
